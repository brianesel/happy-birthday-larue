        Happy birthday!
        20 now eyh :), big step right? Except for some reasons <p class='important-words'>I</p> have never consider you are that young. Mature is the word. 
        Remeber when I said I see fire in your beautiful eyes? I am scared sometimes, but I am scared of losing that. I see thoughts, passions, ambitions are burning. I <p class='important-words'>LOVE</p> it. I love seeing you getting excited about things you like, climbing, literature ( not for me i am sorry), words, history,... 
        Dont worry, you are still young :). No need to rush.
        You are my fire. You ignite things inside me that I did not think I could have done myself. You said that I am curious and lively. Well guess what, you gave me the fuel to do it. And I am sure, not only me would feel that way. You gave me ideas and supports. A teacher, I can say. You are a cold fire and a hot one. You keep me chilled and warmed. My world might be burning, but your fire keep it intact.
        This might bored you already but Laure. <p class='important-words'>YOU </p>  are beatiful, the way you are :). You don't know how lucky I feel sometimes. Maybe I am lucky.
        Don't burn yourself out, but keep it up. Keep moving forward right? Let it burn :).
